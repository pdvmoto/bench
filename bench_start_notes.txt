notes on running benchmarks.

related files:
 - bench_go_start.sql
 - bench_go_run.sql   (many need editing to set timeout and/or sleep call)
 - to.bat (timeout, the windows-7 equivalent of sleep.exe or sleep on unix)


Here is the trick to start benchmarks either all-at-once or staggered.


Set a starting point in controlling session:
SQL> @bench_go_start.sql

This will set an SQL-plus session to the point where you can hit "ENTER" to start...


To set slaves:
SQL> @bench_go_run.sql

This will set slaves to wait for the "ENTER"  in the bench-go-start.
Each of the slaves will either start (near)immediate, or they 
will wait to start staggered by a nr of seconds (hardcoded in the bench-go-start)
